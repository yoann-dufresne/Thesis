	volume = {3},
	issn = {1074-5521},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A structurally diverse group of bioactive peptides is synthesized by peptide synthetases which act as templates for a growing peptide chain, attached to the enzyme via a thioester bond. The protein templates are composed of distinctive substrate-activating modules, whose order dictates the primary structure of the corresponding peptide product. Each module contains defined domains that catalyze adenylation, thioester and peptide bond formation, as well as substrate modifications. To show that a putative thiolation domain ({PCP}) is involved in covalent binding and transfer of amino acyl residues during non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, we have cloned and biochemically characterized that region of tyrocidine synthetase 1, {TycA}.
{RESULTS}: The 327-bp gene fragment encoding {PCP} was cloned using its homology to the genes for the acyl carrier proteins of fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis. The protein was expressed as a His6 fusion protein, and purified in a single step by affinity chromatography. Incorporation of beta-[3H]alanine, a precursor of coenzyme A, demonstrated the modification of {PCP} with the cofactor 4'-phosphopantetheine. When an adenylation domain is present to supply the amino adenylate moiety, {PCP} can be acylated in vitro.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {PCP} can bind covalently to the cofactor phosphopantetheine and can subsequently be acylated, strongly supporting the multiple carrier model of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. The adenylation and thiolation domains can each act as independent multifunctional enzymes, further confirming the modular structure of peptide synthases, and can also perform sequential steps in trans, as do multienzyme complexes.},

One possible explanation was that the majority of introduced C domains were unable to effectively communicate with the thiolation (T) domain immediately upstream, in the first module of {PvdD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many pharmacologically important peptides are synthesized nonribosomally by multimodular peptide synthetases ({NRPSs}). These enzyme templates consist of iterated modules that, in their number and organization, determine the primary structure of the corresponding peptide products. At the core of each module is an adenylation domain that recognizes the cognate substrate and activates it as its aminoacyl adenylate. Recently, the crystal structure of the phenylalanine-activating adenylation domain {PheA} was solved with phenylalanine and {AMP}, illustrating the structural basis for substrate recognition.
{RESULTS}: By comparing the residues that line the phenylalanine-binding pocket in {PheA} with the corresponding moieties in other adenylation domains, general rules for deducing substrate specificity were developed. We tested these in silico 'rules' by mutating specificity-conferring residues within {PheA}. The substrate specificity of most mutants was altered or relaxed. Generalization of the selectivity determinants also allowed the targeted specificity switch of an aspartate-activating adenylation domain, the crystal structure of which has not yet been solved, by introducing a single mutation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In silico studies and structure-function mutagenesis have defined general rules for the structural basis of substrate recognition in adenylation domains of {NRPSs}. These rules can be used to rationally alter the specificity of adenylation domains and to predict from the primary sequence the specificity of biochemically uncharacterized adenylation domains. Such efforts could enhance the structural diversity of peptide antibiotics such as penicillins, cyclosporins and vancomycins by allowing synthesis of 'unnatural' natural products.},

	abstract = {Recently, considerable insight has been gained into the modular organization and catalytic properties of nonribosomal peptide synthetases. However, molecular and biochemical aspects of the condensation of two aminoacyl substrates or a peptidyl and an aminoacyl substrate, leading to the formation of a peptide bond, have remained essentially impenetrable. To investigate this crucial part of nonribosomal peptide synthesis, an in vitro assay for a dipeptide formation was developed. Two recombinant holomodules, {GrsA} ({PheATE}), providing D-Phe, and a C-terminally truncated {TycB}, corresponding to the first, L-Pro-incorporating module ({ProCAT}), were investigated. Upon combination of the two aminoacylated modules, a fast reaction is observed, due to the formation of the linear dipeptide D-Phe-L-Pro-S-enzyme on {ProCAT}, followed by a noncatalyzed release of the dipeptide from the enzyme. The liberated product was identified by {TLC}, high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C {NMR}, and comparison with a chemically synthesized standard to be the expected D-Phe-L-Pro diketopiperazine. Further minimization of the two modules was not possible without a loss of transfer activity. Likewise, a mutation in a proposed active-site motif ({HHXXXDG}) of the condensation domain giving {ProCAT}(H147V), abolished the condensation reaction. These results strongly suggest the condensation domain to be involved in the catalysis of nonribosomal peptide bond formation with the histidine 147 playing a catalytic role.},

Whereas bacterial {NRPSs} use thioesterase domains to perform the cyclization, fungal {NRPSs} have apparently evolved to use a different enzymatic route. In verified fungal {NRPSs} that produce macrocyclic peptides, each megasynthetase terminates with a condensation-like ({CT}) domain that may perform the macrocyclization reaction. To probe the role of such a {CT} domain, we reconstituted the activities of the Penicillium aethiopicum trimodular {NPRS} {TqaA} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro. Together with the reconstituted bimodular {NRPS} {AnaPS}, we dissected the cyclization steps of {TqaA} in transforming the linear anthranilate-D-tryptophan-L-alanyl tripeptide into fumiquinazoline F. Extensive biochemical and mutational studies confirmed the essential role of the {CT} domain in catalyzing cyclization in a thiolation domain–dependent fashion. Our work provides evidence of a likely universal macrocyclization strategy used by fungal {NRPSs}.

The first 6 residues of the biosurfactant lipopeptidolactone arthrofactin have the D configuration, yet none of the 11 modules of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly line have epimerization domains. We show that the two-module {ArfA} subunit and the first module of the {ArfB} subunit, which act in tandem to produce the N-acyl-D-Leu1-D-Asp2-D-Thr3-S-protein intermediate, activate the L amino acids and epimerize them as the aminoacyl-S-pantetheinyl T domain intermediates before the next downstream condensation. The condensation (C) domains are shown to have {DCL} chirality in peptide bond formation. The upstream aminoacyl/peptidyl moiety is epimerized before condensation only when the condensation domains are simultaneously presented with the L-aminoacyl-S-pantetheinyl acceptor. These {DCL} catalysts are dual function condensation/epimerization domains that can be predicted by bioinformatics analysis to be responsible for incorporation of all D residues in arthrofactin and of D residues in syringomycin, syringopeptin, and ramoplanin synthetases.},

The 84 kb gene cluster contains 25 {ORFs} and is located within a 116 kb genetic locus that was fully sequenced. Targeted disruption of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase ({NRPS}) genes in the cluster abolished enduracidin production and confirmed function. The cluster includes four genes, {endA}-D, encoding two-, seven-, eight- and one-module {NRPSs}, respectively, and includes unique modules for the incorporation of citrulline and enduracididine. The {NRPS} organization generally follows the collinearity principle, and starts with a condensation domain (C domain) similar to those found in other lipopeptide systems for the coupling of an acyl group to the starting amino acid. The sixth module of {EndB}, corresponding to Thr8, is missing an adenylation domain (A domain) and this module is presumed to be loaded in trans by the single module protein {EndD}. The most striking feature of the {NRPS} organization is the lack of epimerization domains (E domains) in light of the fact that the product has seven d-amino acid residues. Sequence analysis reveals that C domains following modules corresponding to d-amino acids belong to a unique subset of C domains able to catalyse both epimerization and condensation reactions. Other genes directing lipid modification and activation, and formation of the non-proteinogenic amino acids 4-hydroxyphenylglycine and enduracididine are readily identified, as are genes possibly involved in regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis and export. These findings provide the basis to further genetically manipulate and improve lipodepsipeptide antibiotics via combinatorial and chemical methods.},

The excised {TE} domain from the nonribosomal peptide synthetase responsible for the production of the cyclic decapeptide tyrocidine A, {TycC} {TE}, retains autonomous ability to catalyze head-to-tail macrocyclization of a linear peptide thioester with the native sequence of tyrocidine A and can additionally cyclize peptide analogs that incorporate limited alterations in the peptide sequence. Here we show that {TycC} {TE} can catalyze macrocyclization of peptide substrates that are dramatically different from the native tyrocidine linear precursor. Several peptide thioesters that retain a limited number of elements of the native peptide sequence are shown to be substrates for {TycC} {TE}. These peptides were designed to integrate an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence that confers potential activity in the inhibition of ligand binding by integrin receptors. Although enzymatic hydrolysis of the peptide thioester substrates is preferred over cyclization, {TycC} {TE} can be used on a preparative scale to generate both linear and cyclic peptide products for functional characterization. The products are shown to be inhibitors of ligand binding by integrin receptors, with cyclization and Nα-methylation being important contributors to the nanomolar potency of the best inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to α{IIbβ}3 integrin. This study provides evidence for {TycC} {TE} as a versatile macrocyclization catalyst and raises the prospect of using {TE} catalysis for the generation of diverse macrocyclic peptide libraries that can be probed for novel biological function.},

	abstract = {In the biosynthesis of many macrocyclic natural products by multidomain megasynthases, a carboxy-terminal thioesterase ({TE}) domain is involved in cyclization and product release; however, it has not been determined whether {TE} domains can catalyse macrocyclization (and elongation in the case of symmetric cyclic peptides) independently of upstream domains. The inability to decouple the {TE} cyclization step from earlier chain assembly steps has precluded determination of {TE} substrate specificity, which is important for the engineered biosynthesis of new compounds. Here we report that the excised {TE} domain from tyrocidine synthetase efficiently catalyses cyclization of a decapeptide-thioester to form the antibiotic tyrocidine A, and can catalyse pentapeptide-thioester dimerization followed by cyclization to form the antibiotic gramicidin S. By systematically varying the decapeptide-thioester substrate and comparing cyclization rates, we also show that only two residues (one near each end of the decapeptide) are critical for cyclization. This specificity profile indicates that the tyrocidine synthetase {TE}, and by analogy many other {TE} domains, will be able to cyclize and release a broad range of new substrates and products produced by engineered enzymatic assembly lines.},

By combining sequence‐based knowledge with biochemical precedent, translated gene sequence data can be used to rapidly derive structural elements encoded by secondary metabolic gene clusters from microorganisms. These structural elements provide an estimate of the secondary metabolic potential of a given organism and a starting point for identification of potential lead compounds in isolation/structure elucidation campaigns. The accuracy of these predictions for a given translated gene sequence depends on the biochemistry of the metabolite class, similarity to known metabolite gene clusters, and depth of knowledge concerning its biosynthetic machinery. This chapter introduces methods for prediction of structural elements for two well‐studied classes: modular polyketides and nonribosomally encoded peptides. A bioinformatics tool is presented for rapid preliminary analysis of these modular systems, and prototypical methods for converting these analyses into substructural elements are described.},

We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on the example of aryl acid-activating and amino acid-activating adenylation domains (A domains) of nonribosomal peptide synthetases ({NRPS}). The residues of gramicidin synthetase A that are 8 Å around the substrate amino acid and corresponding positions of other adenylation domain sequences with 397 known and unknown specificities were extracted and used to encode this physico-chemical fingerprint into normalized real-valued feature vectors based on the physico-chemical properties of the amino acids. The {SVM} software package {SVMlight} was used for training and classification, with transductive {SVMs} to take advantage of the information inherent in unlabeled data. Specificities for very similar substrates that frequently show cross-specificities were pooled to the so-called composite specificities and predictive models were built for them. The reliability of the models was confirmed in cross-validations and in comparison with a currently used sequence-comparison-based method. When comparing the predictions for 1230 {NRPS} A domains that are currently detectable in {UniProt}, the new method was able to give a specificity prediction in an additional 18\% of the cases compared with the old method. For 70\% of the sequences both methods agreed, for {\textless}6\% they did not, mainly on low-confidence predictions by the existing method. None of the predictive methods could infer any specificity for 2.4\% of the sequences, suggesting completely new types of specificity.},

Prediction of A-domain specificity based on the sequence alone can be achieved through sequence signatures or, more accurately, through machine learning methods. We present an improved predictor, based on previous work ({NRPSpredictor}), that predicts A-domain specificity using Support Vector Machines on four hierarchical levels, ranging from gross physicochemical properties of an A-domain’s substrates down to single amino acid substrates. The three more general levels are predicted with an F-measure better than 0.89 and the most detailed level with an average F-measure of 0.80. We also modeled the applicability domain of our predictor to estimate for new A-domains whether they lie in the applicability domain. Finally, since there are also {NRPS} that play an important role in natural products chemistry of fungi, such as peptaibols and cephalosporins, we added a predictor for fungal A-domains, which predicts gross physicochemical properties with an F-measure of 0.84.

Genes involved in their biosynthesis are often organized in clusters, i.e., are co-localized and co-expressed.

{RESULTS}: We present Cluster Assignment by Islands of Sites ({CASSIS}), a method for {SM} cluster prediction in eukaryotic genomes, and Secondary Metabolites by {InterProScan} ({SMIPS}), a tool for genome-wide detection of {SM} key enzymes ('anchor' genes): polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases. Unlike other tools based on protein similarity, {CASSIS} exploits the idea of co-regulation of the cluster genes, which assumes the existence of common regulatory patterns in the cluster promoters. The method searches for 'islands' of enriched cluster-specific motifs in the vicinity of anchor genes. It was validated in a series of cross-validation experiments and showed high sensitivity and specificity.

The transcriptional expression of these genes is often cooperatively regulated by a transcription factor located inside or close to a cluster. Most of the secondary metabolism biosynthesis ({SMB}) gene clusters identified to date contain so-called core genes with distinctive sequence features, such as polyketide synthase ({PKS}) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase ({NRPS}). Recent efforts in sequencing fungal genomes have revealed far more {SMB} gene clusters than expected based on the number of core genes in the genomes. Several bioinformatics tools have been developed to survey {SMB} gene clusters using the sequence motif information of the core genes, including {SMURF} and {antiSMASH}. More recently, accompanied by the development of sequencing techniques allowing to obtain large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data, motif-independent prediction methods of {SMB} gene clusters, including {MIDDAS}-M, have been developed. Most these methods detect the clusters in which the genes are cooperatively regulated at transcriptional levels, thus allowing the identification of novel {SMB} gene clusters regardless of the presence of the core genes. Another type of the method, {MIPS}-{CG}, uses the characteristics of {SMB} genes, which are highly enriched in non-syntenic blocks ({NSBs}), enabling the prediction even without transcriptome data although the results have not been evaluated in detail. Considering that large portion of {SMB} gene clusters might be sufficiently expressed only in limited uncommon conditions, it seems that prediction of {SMB} gene clusters by bioinformatics and successive experimental validation is an only way to efficiently uncover hidden {SMB} gene clusters. Here, we describe and discuss possible novel approaches for the determination of {SMB} gene clusters that have not been identified using conventional methods.},

	abstract = {New bioinformatic tools are needed to analyze the growing volume of {DNA} sequence data. This is especially true in the case of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, where the highly repetitive nature of the associated genes creates major challenges for accurate sequence assembly and analysis. Here we introduce the web tool Natural Product Domain Seeker ({NaPDoS}), which provides an automated method to assess the secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene diversity and novelty of strains or environments. {NaPDoS} analyses are based on the phylogenetic relationships of sequence tags derived from polyketide synthase ({PKS}) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase ({NRPS}) genes, respectively. The sequence tags correspond to {PKS}-derived ketosynthase domains and {NRPS}-derived condensation domains and are compared to an internal database of experimentally characterized biosynthetic genes. {NaPDoS} provides a rapid mechanism to extract and classify ketosynthase and condensation domains from {PCR} products, genomes, and metagenomic datasets. Close database matches provide a mechanism to infer the generalized structures of secondary metabolites while new phylogenetic lineages provide targets for the discovery of new enzyme architectures or mechanisms of secondary metabolite assembly. Here we outline the main features of {NaPDoS} and test it on four draft genome sequences and two metagenomic datasets. The results provide a rapid method to assess secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene diversity and richness in organisms or environments and a mechanism to identify genes that may be associated with uncharacterized biochemistry.},

In bacteria and fungi, in addition to the traditional ribosomal proteic biosynthesis, an alternative ribosome-independent pathway called {NRP} synthesis allows peptide production. It is performed by huge protein complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases ({NRPSs}). The molecules synthesized by {NRPS} contain a high proportion of nonproteogenic amino acids. The primary structure of these peptides is not always linear but often more complex and may contain cycles and branchings. In recent years, {NRPs} attracted a lot of attention because of their biological activities and pharmacological properties (antibiotic, immunosuppressor, antitumor, etc.). However, few computational resources and tools dedicated to those peptides have been available so far. Norine is focused on {NRPs} and contains more than 700 entries. The database is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/norine/. It provides a complete computational tool for systematic study of {NRPs} in numerous species, and as such, should permit to obtain a better knowledge of these metabolic products and underlying biological mechanisms, and ultimately to contribute to the redesigning of natural products in order to obtain new bioactive compounds for drug discovery.},

	abstract = {The Protein Data Bank ({PDB}) is the single global repository for three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules and their complexes, and its more than 100 000 structures contain more than 20 000 distinct ligands or small molecules bound to proteins and nucleic acids. Information about these small molecules and their interactions with proteins and nucleic acids is crucial for our understanding of biochemical processes and vital for structure-based drug design. Small molecules present in a deposited structure may be attached to a polymer or may occur as a separate, non-covalently linked ligand. During curation of a newly deposited structure by {wwPDB} annotation staff, each molecule is cross-referenced to the {PDB} Chemical Component Dictionary ({CCD}). If the molecule is new to the {PDB}, a dictionary description is created for it. The information about all small molecule components found in the {PDB} is distributed via the ftp archive as an external reference file. Small molecule annotation in the {PDB} also includes information about ligand-binding sites and about covalent and other linkages between ligands and macromolecules. During the remediation of the peptide-like antibiotics and inhibitors present in the {PDB} archive in 2011, it became clear that additional annotation was required for consistent representation of these molecules, which are quite often composed of several sequential subcomponents including modified amino acids and other chemical groups. The connectivity information of the modified amino acids is necessary for correct representation of these biologically interesting molecules. The combined information is made available via a new resource called the Biologically Interesting molecules Reference Dictionary, which is complementary to the {CCD} and is now routinely used for annotation of peptide-like antibiotics and inhibitors.},

	abstract = {Nonribosomal peptides ({NRPs}), bioactive secondary metabolites produced by many microorganisms, show a broad range of important biological activities (e.g. antibiotics, immunosuppressants, antitumor agents). {NRPs} are mainly composed of amino acids but their primary structure is not always linear and can contain cycles or branchings. Furthermore, there are several hundred different monomers that can be incorporated into {NRPs}. The {NORINE} database, the first resource entirely dedicated to {NRPs}, currently stores more than 700 {NRPs} annotated with their monomeric peptide structure encoded by undirected labeled graphs. This opens a way to a systematic analysis of structural patterns occurring in {NRPs}. Such studies can investigate the functional role of some monomeric chains, or analyse {NRPs} that have been computationally predicted from the synthetase protein sequence. A basic operation in such analyses is the search for a given structural pattern in the database.},

To support scientific advancements and ensure the best quality and completeness of the data files over the next 10 years and beyond, the Worldwide {PDB} partnership that manages the {PDB} archive is developing a new deposition and annotation system. This system focuses on efficient data capture across all supported experimental methods. The new deposition and annotation system is composed of four major modules that together support all of the processing requirements for a {PDB} entry. In this article, we describe one such module called the Chemical Component Annotation Tool. This tool uses information from both the Chemical Component Dictionary and Biologically Interesting molecule Reference Dictionary to aid in annotation. Benchmark studies have shown that the Chemical Component Annotation Tool provides significant improvements in processing efficiency and data quality. Database {URL}: http://wwpdb.org},

	abstract = {Natural products and synthetic compounds are a valuable source of new small molecules leading to novel drugs to cure diseases. However identifying new biologically active small molecules is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new activity prediction approach using Bayesian belief network for classification ({BBNC}). The roots of the network are the fragments composing a compound. The leaves are, on one side, the activities to predict and, on another side, the unknown compound. The activities are represented by sets of known compounds, and sets of inactive compounds are also used. We calculated a similarity between an unknown compound and each activity class. The more similar activity is assigned to the unknown compound. We applied this new approach on eight well-known data sets extracted from the literature and compared its performance to three classical machine learning algorithms. Experiments showed that {BBNC} provides interesting prediction rates (from 79\% accuracy for high diverse data sets to 99\% for low diverse ones) with a short time calculation. Experiments also showed that {BBNC} is particularly effective for homogeneous data sets but has been found to perform less well with structurally heterogeneous sets. However, it is important to stress that we believe that using several approaches whenever possible for activity prediction can often give a broader understanding of the data than using only one approach alone. Thus, {BBNC} is a useful addition to the computational chemist?s toolbox.},

So, nonribosomal peptides ({NRPs}) are the basis for some efficient drugs. While discovering new {NRPs} is very desirable, the process of identifying their biological activity to be used as drugs is a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel peptide fingerprint based on monomer composition ({MCFP}) of {NRPs}. {MCFP} is a novel method for obtaining a representative description of {NRP} structures from their monomer composition in fingerprint form. Experiments with Norine {NRPs} database and {MCFP} show high prediction accuracy ({\textgreater}93 \%). Also a high recall rate ({\textgreater}82 \%) is obtained when {MCFP} is used for screening {NRPs} database. From this study it appears that our fingerprint, built from monomer composition, allows an effective screening and prediction of biological activities of {NRPs} database.},

The goal of yet another open-source {SMARTS} parser implementation is to achieve better performance and compatibility with multiple existing flavours of the {SMARTS} language, as well as to provide utilities for running efficient {SMARTS} queries in large structural databases. We describe a combination of approaches towards lowering the computational cost and improving the response time of substructure queries. An exhaustive comparison of the {AMBIT} algorithm with several subgraph isomorphism implementations is performed. To demonstrate the performance of the entire system from an end-user point of view, response time statistics for Web service substructure search queries against a database of 4.5 M structures are also reported. The package has wide applicability in the implementation of various chemoinformatics tasks. It has already been used in several projects dealing with descriptor calculation and predictive algorithms, database queries, web applications and web services.},

Given a set of small molecules—for example, those known to bind a particular protein—computationally decomposing them into chemically meaningful fragments can help elucidate their functional properties, and may be useful for designing novel compounds with similar properties. Here we introduce {molBLOCKS}, a suite of programs for breaking down sets of small molecules into fragments according to a predefined set of chemical rules, clustering the resulting fragments, and uncovering statistically enriched fragments. Among other applications, our software should be a great aid in large-scale chemical analysis of ligands binding specific targets of interest.

This paper extends a characterization given by Harary and Norman for linedigraphs. It is also possible to repeatedly contract vertices of the line-digraph (with a new contraction procedure) so as to obtain the digraph derived from D by deleting all vertices with no incoming edges. Several new identities for arborescences are presented, leading to a combinatorial proof of Knuth's formula for the number of arborescences of a line-digraph. A new proof is given for the fact that in a digraph with every vertex having indegree equal to outdegree, the number of arborescences with root Vj is independent of j. Finally a new proof is presented for Tutte's Matrix Tree Theorem which shows the theorem to be a special case of the principle of inclusion-exclusion.},

In the present study, the production of beauvericin and newly found enniatins (H, I, and {MK}1688) was characterized in 28 Fusarium strains isolated from potato samples in Korea. The predominant Fusarium species in potato was F. oxysporum (53.6\%). Fifteen strains of F. oxysporum and two strains of other Fusarium species produced beauvericin (at concentrations from 3.1 to 743.2 microg/g) in culture on rice. Enniatins H and I were produced by 3 and 11 strains at concentrations from 33.1 to 781.3 microg/g and from 6.5 to 730.3 microg/g, respectively. Five isolates produced enniatin {MK}1688 at concentrations from 4.6 to 432.6 microg/g. In particular, one isolate (No. 1501) identified as F. oxysporum and two other Fusarium strains (Nos. 804 and 910) produced all of the tested toxins. These results indicate that enniatins H, I, and {MK}1688 and beauvericin are produced by Fusarium isolates occurring on potato. We do not know if the toxins can accumulate in the environment since it was not demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Molecular similarity is a pervasive concept in chemistry. It is essential to many aspects of chemical reasoning and analysis and is perhaps the fundamental assumption underlying medicinal chemistry. Dissimilarity, the complement of similarity, also plays a major role in a growing number of applications of molecular diversity in combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, and related fields. How molecular information is represented, called the representation problem, is important to the type of molecular similarity analysis ({MSA}) that can be carried out in any given situation. In this work, four types of mathematical structure are used to represent molecular information: sets, graphs, vectors, and functions. Molecular similarity is a pairwise relationship that induces structure into sets of molecules, giving rise to the concept of chemical space. Although all three concepts - molecular similarity, molecular representation, and chemical space - are treated in this chapter, the emphasis is on molecular similarity measures. Similarity measures, also called similarity coefficients or indices, are functions that map pairs of compatible molecular representations that are of the same mathematical form into real numbers usually, but not always, lying on the unit interval. This chapter presents a somewhat pedagogical discussion of many types of molecular similarity measures, their strengths and limitations, and their relationship to one another. An expanded account of the material on chemical spaces presented in the first edition of this book is also provided. It includes a discussion of the topography of activity landscapes and the role that activity cliffs in these landscapes play in structure-activity studies.},

The most fundamental support needed in these applications is the efficient search of complex structured data. Since exact matching is often too restrictive, similarity search of complex structures becomes a vital operation that must be supported efficiently.In this paper, we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed missing features, our structural filtering algorithm, called Grafil, can filter many graphs without performing pairwise similarity computations. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature set selection strategy for filtering. By examining the effect of different feature selection mechanisms, we develop a multi-filter composition strategy, where each filter uses a distinct and complementary subset of the features. We identify the criteria to form effective feature sets for filtering, and demonstrate that combining features with similar size and selectivity can improve the filtering and search performance significantly. Moreover, the concept presented in Grafil can be applied to searching approximate non-consecutive sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well.},

Graph edit distance is one of the most widely accepted measures to determine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in the fields of pattern recognition, computer vision etc. Unfortunately, the problem of graph edit distance computation is {NP}-Hard in general. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce three novel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between two graphs in polynomial time. Applying these methods, two algorithms {AppFull} and {AppSub} are introduced to perform different kinds of graph search on graph databases. Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to examine various aspects of the methods for bounding graph edit distance. Result shows that these methods achieve good scalability in terms of both the number of graphs and the size of graphs. The effectiveness of these algorithms also confirms the usefulness of using our bounds in filtering and searching of graphs.},

The problem is challenging as even testing subgraph containment between two graphs is {NP}-complete. Hence, existing techniques adopt the filtering-and-verification framework with the focus on developing effective and efficient techniques to remove non-promising graphs. Nevertheless, existing filtering techniques may be still unable to effectively remove many "low" quality candidates. To resolve this, in this paper we propose a novel indexing technique, {GrafD}-Index, to index graphs according to their "distances" to features. We characterize a tight condition under which the distance-based triangular inequality holds. We then develop lower and upper bounding techniques that exploit the {GrafD}-Index to (1) prune non-promising graphs and (2) include graphs whose similarities are guaranteed to exceed the given similarity threshold. Considering that the verification phase is not well studied and plays the dominant role in the whole process, we devise efficient algorithms to verify candidates. A comprehensive experiment using real datasets demonstrates that our proposed methods significantly outperform existing methods.},

A detailed computational study is performed in order to identify strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithms and the role of the different components on several classes of instances. The tested algorithms are very fast and reliable: most of the {DIMACS} benchmark instances are solved within very short {CPU} times. For one of the hardest tests, a new putative optimum was discovered by one of our algorithms. Very good performances were also shown on recently proposed and more difficult instances. It is important to remark that the heuristics tested in this paper are basically parameter free (the appropriate value for the unique parameter is easily identified and was, in fact, the same value for all problem instances used in this paper).},

This calculation can be formalized as the maximum common substructure ({MCS}) problem, which is well-studied and has been shown to be {NP}-complete. Although many rigorous and heuristic algorithms have been developed, none of these algorithms is sufficiently fast and accurate. We developed a new program, called ?kcombu? using a build-up algorithm, which is a type of the greedy heuristic algorithms. The program can search connected and disconnected {MCSs} as well as topologically constrained disconnected {MCS} ({TD}-{MCS}), which is introduced in this study. To evaluate the performance of our program, we prepared two correct standards: the exact correspondences generated by the maximum clique algorithms and the 3D correspondences obtained from superimposed 3D structure of the molecules in a complex 3D structure with the same protein. For the five sets of molecules taken from the protein structure database, the agreement value between the build-up and the exact correspondences for the connected {MCS} is sufficiently high, but the computation time of the build-up algorithm is much smaller than that of the exact algorithm. The comparison between the build-up and the 3D correspondences shows that the {TD}-{MCS} has the best agreement value among the other types of {MCS}. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between the molecular similarity and the agreement with the correct and 3D correspondences; more similar molecule pairs are more correctly matched. Molecular pairs with more than 40\% Tanimoto similarities can be correctly matched for more than half of the atoms with the 3D correspondences.},

	abstract = {An induced matching M⊆{EM}{\textbackslash}subseteq E in a graph G=(V,E)G=(V, E) is a matching such that no two edges in {MM} are joined by any third edge of the graph. The Maximum Induced Matching problem is to find an induced matching of maximum cardinality. It is {NP}-hard. Branch-and-reduce algorithms proposed in the previous results for the Maximum Induced Matching problem use a standard branching rule: for a vertex vv , it branches into deg(v)+1deg(v)+1 subproblems that either vv is not an endvertex of any edge in {MM} or vv and one of its neighbor are endvertices of an edge in {MM} . In this paper, we give a simple branch-and-reduce algorithm consisting of a boundary condition, a reduction rule, and a branching rule. Especially, the branching rule only branches the original problem into two subproblems. When the algorithm meets the input instance satisfying the boundary condition, we reduce the Maximum Induced Matching problem to the Maximum Independent Set problem. By using the measure-and-conquer approach to analyze the running time of the algorithm, we show that this algorithm runs in time O∗(1.4658n)O{\textasciicircum}\{*\}(1.4658{\textasciicircum}n) which is faster than previously known algorithms. By adding two branching rules in the simple exact algorithm, we obtain an O∗(1.4321n)O{\textasciicircum}\{*\}(1.4321{\textasciicircum}n) -time algorithm for the Maximum Induced Matching problem. Moreover, we give a moderately exponential time ρ{\textbackslash}rho -approximation algorithm, 0{\textless}ρ{\textless}10 {\textless} {\textbackslash}rho {\textless} 1 , for the Maximum Induced Matching problem.

Results: This paper presents a novel global network alignment algorithm, denoted as {HubAlign}, that makes use of both network topology and sequence homology information, based upon the observation that topologically important proteins in a {PPI} network usually are much more conserved and thus, more likely to be aligned. {HubAlign} uses a minimum-degree heuristic algorithm to estimate the topological and functional importance of a protein from the global network topology information. Then {HubAlign} aligns topologically important proteins first and gradually extends the alignment to the whole network. Extensive tests indicate that {HubAlign} greatly outperforms several popular methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, especially in detecting functionally similar proteins.

For the maximum common subgraph problem, exact and inexact algorithms are known from the literature. Nevertheless, until now no effort has been done for characterizing their performance, mainly for the lack of a large database of graphs. In this paper, three exact and well-known algorithms for maximum common subgraph detection are described. Moreover, a large database containing various categories of pairs of graphs (e.g. randomly connected graphs, meshes, bounded valence graphs...), having a maximum common subgraph of at least two nodes, is presented, and the performance of the three algorithms is evaluated on this database.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The ability to accurately measure structural similarities among small molecules is important for many analysis routines in drug discovery and chemical genomics. Algorithms used for this purpose include fragment-based fingerprint and graph-based maximum common substructure ({MCS}) methods. {MCS} approaches provide one of the most accurate similarity measures. However, their rigid matching policies limit them to the identification of perfect {MCSs}. To eliminate this restriction, we introduce a new mismatch tolerant search method for identifying flexible {MCSs} ({FMCSs}) containing a user-definable number of atom and/or bond mismatches.
Results: The {fmcsR} package provides an R interface, with the time-consuming steps of the {FMCS} algorithm implemented in C++. It includes utilities for pairwise compound comparisons, structure similarity searching, clustering and visualization of {MCSs}. In comparison with an existing {MCS} tool, {fmcsR} shows better time performance over a wide range of compound sizes. When mismatching of atoms or bonds is turned on, the compute times increase as expected, and the resulting {FMCSs} are often substantially larger than their strict {MCS} counterparts. Based on extensive virtual screening ({VS}) tests, the flexible matching feature enhances the enrichment of active structures at the top of {MCS}-based similarity search results. With respect to overall and early enrichment performance, {FMCS} outperforms most of the seven other {VS} methods considered in these tests.

We also study a variant of this problem where the subgraph is required to be connected. We introduce a filtering algorithm for this property and show that it may be combined with a restricted branching technique for the constraint-based approach. We show how to implement a similar branching technique in clique-inspired algorithms. Finally, we experimentally compare approaches for the connected version, and see again that the best choice depends on whether graphs have labels.},

We provide a solution to the problem of matching two trees by constructing the association graph using the graph-theoretic concept of connectivity. We prove that, in the new formulation, there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal cliques and maximal subtree isomorphisms. This allows us to cast the tree matching problem as an indefinite quadratic program using the Motzkin-Straus theorem, and we use “replicator” dynamical systems developed in theoretical biology to solve it. Such continuous solutions to discrete problems are attractive because they can motivate analog and biological implementations. The framework is also extended to the matching of attributed trees by using weighted association graphs. We illustrate the power of the approach by matching articulated and deformed shapes described by shock trees},

	abstract = {Subgraph isomorphism problem is an {NP}-hard problem and the available algorithms are of exponential time complexity. Hence these are not efficient for real world applications. A number of heuristic methods are proposed in the literature in this field. Ullmann[6] proposed a solution for subgraph isomorphism problem in 1976, which is being referred till today. Ullmann’s algorithm is refined to get better algorithms in current literature. Cordella et al.[7] proposed an algorithm {VF}2, that improves Ullmann’s refinement. In this project, we propose a heuristic to be applied to Ullmann’s algorithm in order to reduce the search space. We show that the proposed heuristic performs better than both Ullmann’s and {VF}2 algorithm. The testing is done using a graph generation software[12]. Further the heuristic algorithm is tested on the benchmark data set [4]. Both the experiments show that our proposed heuristics perform better for all type of graphs given in the benchmark data set.},

In particular, if the removal of any set of at most k vertices from an n-vertex graph results in O(klogn) connected components, we say that the graph is a log-bounded fragmentation graph. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a subgraph of H isomorphic to a graph G when G is a log-bounded fragmentation graph and H has bounded treewidth; these results are extended to handle graphs of locally bounded treewidth (a generalization of treewidth) when G is a log-bounded fragmentation graph and has constant diameter.},

	abstract = {The problem of Subgraph Isomorphism is defined as follows: Given a pattern H and a host graph G on n vertices, does G contain a subgraph that is isomorphic to H? Eppstein [{SODA} 95, J'{GAA} 99] gives the first linear time algorithm for subgraph isomorphism for a fixed-size pattern, say of order k, and arbitrary planar host graph, improving upon the O(n{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\})-time algorithm when using the ``Color-coding'' technique of Alon et al [J'{ACM} 95]. Eppstein's algorithm runs in time k{\textasciicircum}O(k) n, that is, the dependency on k is superexponential. We solve an open problem posed in Eppstein's paper and improve the running time to 2{\textasciicircum}O(k) n, that is, single exponential in k while keeping the term in n linear. Next to deciding subgraph isomorphism, we can construct a solution and enumerate all solutions in the same asymptotic running time. We may list w subgraphs with an additive term O(w k) in the running time of our algorithm. We introduce the technique of "embedded dynamic programming" on a suitably structured graph decomposition, which exploits the topology of the underlying embeddings of the subgraph pattern (rather than of the host graph). To achieve our results, we give an upper bound on the number of partial solutions in each dynamic programming step as a function of pattern size--as it turns out, for the planar subgraph isomorphism problem, that function is single exponential in the number of vertices in the pattern.},

Enzyme engineering has progressed considerably in recent years and offers new screening, modelling, and design tools for natural product designers. Here, recent advances in enzyme engineering and their application to nonribosomal peptide synthetases are reviewed. Among the nonribosomal peptides that have been subjected to biosynthetic engineering are the antibiotics daptomycin, calcium-dependent antibiotic, and gramicidin S. With these peptides, incorporation of unnatural building blocks and modulation of bioactivities via various structural modifications have been successfully demonstrated. Natural product engineering on the biosynthetic level is not a reliable method yet. However, progress in the understanding and manipulation of biosynthetic pathways may enable the routine production of optimized peptide drugs in the near future.

	abstract = {The limits and potential of substrate promiscuity of the adenylation domain of tyrocidine synthetase 1 were systematically explored. Substrate acceptance is governed by hydrophobic effects (as shown by the correlation of kcat/{KM} and side-chain log P), shape complementarity and steric exclusion. The quantification of these factors provides ground rules for understanding and possibly evolving substrate specificity in this class of enzymes. The catalytic potential of tyrocidine synthetase 1 ({TycA}) was probed by the kinetic characterization of its adenylation activity. We observed reactions with 30 substrates, thus suggesting some substrate promiscuity. However, although the {TycA} adenylation (A) domain was able to accommodate alternative substrates, their kcat/{KM} values ranged over six orders of magnitude. A comparison of the activities allowed the systematic mapping of the substrate specificity determinants of the {TycA} A-domain. Hydrophobicity plays a major role in the recognition of substrate analogues but can be combined with shape complementarity, conferring higher activity, and/or steric exclusion, leading to substantial discrimination against larger substrates. A comparison of the kcat/{KM} values of the {TycA} A-domain and phenylalanyl-{tRNA} synthetase showed that the level of discrimination was comparable in the two enzymes for the adenylation reaction and suggested that {TycA} was also subjected to high selective pressure. The specificity patterns observed and the quantification of alternative activities provide a basis for exploring possible paths for the future directed evolution of A-domain specificity.},

The resulting 105-fold switch in substrate specificity was achieved without appreciable loss of catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the effective communication of the modified A domains with downstream modules in dipeptide synthetases permitted incorporation of O-propargyl-L-tyrosine into diketopiperazines both in vitro and in vivo, even in the presence of competing phenylalanine. Because azides and alkynes readily undergo bioorthogonal click reactions, reprogramming {NRPSs} to accept non-natural amino acids that contain these groups provides a potentially powerful means of isolating, labeling, and modifying biologically active peptides.},

Nonribosomal peptide synthetases ({NRPSs}) protect microorganisms from environmental threats by producing diverse siderophores, antibiotics, and other peptide natural products. Their modular molecular structure is also attractive from the standpoint of biosynthetic engineering. Here we evaluate a methodology for swapping module specificities of these mega-enzymes that takes advantage of flavodoxin-like subdomains involved in substrate recognition. Nine subdomains encoding diverse specificities were transplanted into the Phe-specific {GrsA} initiation module of gramicidin S synthetase. All chimeras could be purified as soluble protein. One construct based on a Val-specific subdomain showed sizable adenylation activity and functioned as a Val-Pro diketopiperazine synthetase upon addition of the proline-specific {GrsB}1 module. These results suggest that subdomain swapping could be a viable alternative to previous {NRPS} design approaches targeting binding pockets, domains, or entire modules. The short length of the swapped sequence stretch may facilitate straightforward exploitation of the wealth of existing {NRPS} modules for combinatorial biosynthesis.},

Structural diversity has been introduced by the modification of enzymes required for the supply of precursors or by heterologous expression of tailoring enzymes. The modularity of nonribosomal peptide synthetase ({NRPS}) assembly lines further supports module or domain swapping methodologies to achieve changes in the amino acid sequence of nonribosomal peptides. We also review the new synthetic biology technologies promising to speed up the process, enabling the creation and optimisation of many more assembly lines for heterologous expression, offering new opportunities for engineering the biosynthesis of novel nonribosomal peptides.},

	abstract = {Peptide natural products continue to play an important role in modern medicine as last-resort treatments of many life-threatening diseases, as they display many interesting biological activities ranging from antibiotic to antineoplastic. A large fraction of these microbial natural products is assembled by ribosome-independent mechanisms. Progress in sequencing technology and the mechanistic understanding of secondary metabolite pathways has led to the discovery of many formerly cryptic natural products and a molecular understanding of their assembly. Those advances enable us to apply protein and metabolic engineering approaches towards the manipulation of biosynthetic pathways. In this review we discuss the application potential of both templated and non-templated pathways as well as chemoenzymatic strategies for the structural diversification and tailoring of peptide natural products.},
